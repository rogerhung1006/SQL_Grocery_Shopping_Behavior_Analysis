# Grocery Shopping Behavior Analysis with MySQL
## Introduction
There are two parts in this analytical project. First, I designed the schema and created a database with 4 tables and 50+ million observations. In the second part, I analyzed shoppers' behavior patterns and market opportunities for private-label products by using MySQL queries and visualized the results with Python.
